Yet another lc3-based virtual machine

Based on <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/">this</a> tutorial. <br>
The main goal is to simply propagate multiple implementations of the same thing. <br>
By convention, the first part is written in C, the second one is to be written in Java.<br>

<p><b>Warning</b></p>
<p> VM is not working properly yet, hopefully i'll be able to fix it as soon as possible.</p>
